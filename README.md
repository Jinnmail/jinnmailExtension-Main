# Jinnmail - Privacy for your email address 
The world knows your secrets by email address alone… Jinnmail hides & protects your identity with secret proxy email aliases generated on-demand. Email messages are privately forwarded to ANY inbox. All encrypted, never stored. Open-source.

## README FOR ENTIRE PROJECT
This README represents the entire project; not just than this repository. However, the repository ["jinnmailExtension-Main"](https://github.com/Jinnmail/jinnmailExtension-Main) is for the Chrome extension alone. 

------------------




### HOW JINNMAIL WORKS 
Like a password manager in your browser, Jinnmail detects email submissions & signup forms, auto-populating a new @jinnmail.com address for each. 

When messages are received at any of your Jinnmail aliases, they’re relayed to your real address and immediately discarded. Within seconds, your messages arrive in your Gmail inbox (or other) with the sender’s original name/address/subject intact. You can read, reply, and interact as normal. 

Don’t worry, replies are masked too. Your recipient sees the same @jinnmail.com address, keeping your real address hidden.

Each alias is intuitive, with its related website name right inside the @jinnmail.com address. Aliases are stored and searchable inside the Jinnmail plugin and even pops up when you’re back at that site—just like your password manager does. In fact, save to Google Passwords, Apple Keychain, 1Password, Dashlane, LastPass, Keeper & others so your email/password combo stays updated.


# Get back your privacy
🗝 Companies buy “Customer Enrichment Data” to fill in the gaps with collected knowledge from your accounts, purchases, internet activity, IP & location history, and even current whereabouts! AND THIS IS LEGAL. All they need is your email address.

With Jinnmail, the breadcrumb trail stops here. Automatically be free of surveillance and Big Tech data tracking.



## TOTALLY FREE
While the Jinnmail browser extension is in beta, please use it as much as you want, creating new @jinnmail.com addresses for all your interactions. 



## BENEFITS
✭ ONE-CLICK SPAM KILLER
No more "unsubscribe." With unique addresses for each login, newsletter or app, just one click switches off their emails. Switch on again to reactivate.

✭ STOP JUGGLING MULTIPLE SPAM ACCOUNTS 
Jinnmail's temporary email addresses deliver right to your regular inbox. BUT tame spam—and other unwanted contact—by turning off access to each alias.

✭ THOUSANDS OF EMAIL NAMES UNDER YOUR CONTROL
Addresses are tied to URL/domain & stored encrypted in the Jinnmail browser extension. Save to Google Passwords, Apple Keychain, 1Password, Dashlane, LastPass & more.

✭ AVOID BIG TECH TARGETING & GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE 
Protect your email identity—their key to your data—with thousands of untraceable mini-identities all under your control.

✭ 2FA IS STILL UNSAFE. INTRODUCING 3FA
Make your login email as unguessable as your password. Even if your Gmail is hacked, they still can’t ask your bank or crypto account to bypass 2FA without knowing what alias you registered. These are scrubbed from every message.

✭ DATA BREACH… WHO CARES?!
Your name in a compromised database tempts hackers to access OTHER accounts by trying your credentials. "Forgot password" attempts become impossible without secret email aliases only you know.

✭ OPEN-SOURCE
All code is auditable. Repository at https://github.com/jinnmail.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PLANS
This is a privacy-focused service. Today, Jinnmail usage is anonymous and never stores any messages sent or received. Tomorrow, emphasis will be placed on building in end-to-end encryption, usage of your own PGP/GPG keys, your own domain names, and most importantly, decentralization of the database and email server. Eventually, we’ll enable your own private storage that’s local to—and synced across—your own machines as well as implementing your own private email server. 

The future we envision is one that ensures Jinnmail never has access to your data & can never shut you down, so that even if we get hacked... even if the company becomes compromised… or even if Jinnmail gets shut down… the email keeps flowing uninterrupted and you’re kept safe.
